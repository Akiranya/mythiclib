GENERAL
- support for scoreboards
- support for metadata and variables on entities
- support for bossbars
** support for scopes in variable mechanics
- skill arguments: skills can cache source/target location/entity OR more info like projectiles
    - this would allow for mechanics to change the current direction of a projectile or thrown item
    - oop friendly generalisation of old concept

MECHANICS
** comets (OK with projectiles)
** helixes (circular geometry)
** forward, up, down, circular slashes (spherical geometry)
- projectiles with gravity or bounces with some math normal calculations
- throwable items

CONDITIONS
-
-

TARGETERS
- fix circle targeter using rotating matrixes
- sphere targeter
- cone targeter
